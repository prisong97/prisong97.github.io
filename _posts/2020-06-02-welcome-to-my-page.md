My inspiration for starting this website is to ensure sustained effort on my Capstone. In the face of more urgent submissions during term time, it is convenient to commit less than promised to this project. I hope to avoid this scenario by being sufficiently disciplined. Here is an outline of what I hope to achieve over the following semester (this project will last for a year, but let's talk about next semester, for a start).  

1. Read 1-2 papers a week. Depending on the length of the material, some weeks' readings might bleed into the next. 

2. Do short, weekly write-ups on my takeaways. 

This post is still a work in progress; I shall update it further when I have refined my objectives!
