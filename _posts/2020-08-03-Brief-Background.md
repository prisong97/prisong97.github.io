Assuming that our observations arise from one or more unobserved classes, the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm iteratively finds the maximum likelihood estimates of these classesâ€™ parameters.

As a motivating example, let us consider a random variable X and a set of $m$ i.i.d observations $x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_m$.
