Assuming that our observations arise from one or more unobserved classes, the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm iteratively finds the maximum likelihood estimates of these classes’ parameters.

As a motivating example, let us consider a random variable $$X$$ and a set of $$m$$ i.i.d observations $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m$$. The probability of receiving observation $$x_i$$ is $$\mathbb{P}(x_i \mid \theta)$$, where $$\theta$$ refers to the parameter(s) governing the pdf of distribution $$X$$. Since the observations are i.i.d, we can write the likelihood function as follows:

$$\mathbb{P}{X, \theta} = \prod_{i=1}^mmathbb{P}(x_i \mid \theta)$$. 

Since it is easier to deal with a sum of terms instead of a product, we consider the log-likehood function, as given by

$$\log\mathbb{P}{X, \theta} = \sum_{i=1}^m\logmathbb{P}(x_i \mid \theta)$$

If we know that $$X$$ comprises of $$n$$ subpopulations, then each class $$\in \{z_1,…,z_n\}$$ and $$\sum_z P(z\in Z) = 1$$.
