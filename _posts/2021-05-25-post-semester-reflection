The past semester was an incredibly wild ride. Everything that could have gone wrong, went terribly wrong. This included being hospitalised for a week due to a suspected medical emergency the very week I had a midterm (thank God it was a false alarm).
I was discharged the day right before the exam, and had an MC that exempted me from the assessment. I took the midterm anyway. 

Though the workload this semester was manageable, I found the experience emotionally taxing, and I was mentally all over the place, for reasons yet unknown. Hopefully, I would be able to gain some enlightenment on what had gone wrong.

Despite this struggle, I am grateful for the learning experiences that came my way! Let me first talk about the highlight of my final semester: Stochastic
Processes.

## Stochastic Processes 

Up till the week prior to the start of the semester, I had only been allocated 15MCs worth of modules. All my major requirements were completed and I could essentially take anything under the sun for credit. I was extremely interested in taking a course on Stochastic Processes, and many of my friends warned me against taking the ST-coded 3k Stochastic Processes module. "You don't even learn that much and the bell-curve is very steep". I really wanted to take a module that was worth taking. After-all, it was my final semester, and I still had 20MCs-worth of S/Us to spare. If anything went wrong, I could just fall back on the S/Us. Perusing the NUSmod brief, I stumbled upon EE5137: Stochastic Processes. Interesting...seemed like I could take Stochastic Processes in the Engineering Department! And the pre-requisites were not difficult to meet. After some emails to the Department, Yale-NUS' Registry and the Prof, I was able to enroll in the class. 

Contrary to what many of my friends feel, I absolutely loved this module. There were many encounters
with concepts I had hazy memory of, and it was truly enlightening to enforce some rigour on these fuzzy intuitions. Prior to this course, I knew of Markov Chains only in the
context of MCMC sampling. I knew that Metropolis-Hastings (MH) and Gibbs Sampling fulfilled the detailed balance conditions, but I never fully appreciated its importance when trying to determine if it had a stationary
distribution. These conditions are a little strong, being sufficient but not necessary for guaranteeing the existence of a unique stationary distribution. Now that I think about it, by having a non-zero probability of remaining in the current state,
the markov chain produced by the MH sampler is aperiodic, by design. Coupled with recurrence, this chain is effectively ergodic! Super cool! I also learnt the importance of the second largest eigenvalue in determining the rate of convergence
to the stationary distribution in question (for finite-state markov chains). Around this time, I was also reading material on the autocorrelation between MCMC draws. Though we are now looking at uncountably infinite-state markov chains, I saw that the second-largest
eigenvalue played a part in governing the aforementioned autocorrelation too! I really wished I took this class earlier. 

This class was easily my favourite. I speak as a final year undergraduate who has taken 8 semesters of modules. It's quite unfortunate that I butchered all the assessments (and effectively this course). Besides Real Analysis, I had not been this invested in a module. Not even Machine Learning, which I also loved. I am quite sore that I would have to exercise
my S/U for this class. I know I mentioned that I would have no qualms about exercising these S/Us. And honestly, if I were completely clueless or found out that I absolutely hated the module, I would be embracing these S/Us with unbridled enthusiasm. But I do think the course content was not beyond me -- albeit some struggle, I was genuinely interested and was following for the most part the class. My performance was definitely not reflective of my appreciation for the course.  

I really learnt a lot, both during lectures and office hours. I attended a significant number of office hour sessions, so much so that I ended up befriending two classmates because they had recognised me from the Prof's webcasted sessions. I got to clarify many doubts, and also got to ask many questions that allowed me to bridge the gap in knowledge acquired across classes. I am extremely thankful that the Prof was so open to entertaining my questions and thoughts.

Towards the end of the semester, I chanced upon this beautiful article written by Francis Su: https://www.francissu.com/post/the-lesson-of-grace-in-teaching. I related to this article on an incredibly personal level, because it reminded me of my experience in this class. 

I would not have had it another other way. Curiosity might have killed the cat in this module, but a cat has 9 lives for a reason. I will be back stronger.

Thank you for having me, and thank you for your grace.


## Geometry and the Emergence of Perspective

What happens when you violate the 5th axiom of Euclidean Geometry? By allowing parallel lines to appear convergent at a point of infinity, you get to draw really cool things (check out Perspective Drawing)! Turns out, it is precisely this violation that allows us to incorporate depth into the portrayal of objects. With some experimentation and imagination, you might even end up drawing impossible objects. I wrote a little bit about this in my final assignment, which can be found here: https://ongpriscilla97.medium.com/when-math-and-art-meet-d52222a26b20
