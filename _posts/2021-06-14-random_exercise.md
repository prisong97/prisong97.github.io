In the knockout phase of a football tournament, there are 16 teams of equal skill
that compete in an elimination tournament. This proceeds in a number of rounds in which teams compete in
pairs; any losing team retires from the tournament. What is the probability
that two given teams will compete against each other? Generalize your answer to $2^k$ teams where k is an
arbitrary positive integer.
