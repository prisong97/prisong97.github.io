The past semester was an incredibly wild ride. Everything that could have gone wrong, went terribly wrong. Though the workload was manageable,
I found the experience emotionally taxing, and I was mentally all over the place, for reasons yet unknown.

Despite this struggle, I am grateful for the learning experiences that came my way! Let me first talk about the highlight of my final semester: Stochastic
Processes. This module was an elective I took at the Department of Engineering. Contrary to what many of my friends feel, I absolutely loved this module. There were many encounters
with concepts I had hazy memory of, and it was truly enlightening to enforce some rigour on these fuzzy intuitions. For instance, prior to this course, I knew of Markov Chains only in the
context of MCMC sampling. I knew that Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling fulfilled the detailed balance conditions, but I never fully appreciated its importance in attaining the stationary
distribution, until this course. TBC
