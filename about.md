## A Quick Introduction!

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a rising Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences senior at Yale-NUS College. Very soon, I will be embarking on my Capstone, a year long research project that culminates in a final report. This website serves as a centralised medium for me to consolidate material I encounter throughout this learning journey. I hope to update my progress here as well!

## Some fun facts

 - In 2018, I spent 6 great weeks learning Espa√±ol in Sevilla. Apart from returning with a better grasp of the language, I came back as an experienced Siesta practioner.
 - Before switching to waterpolo, I was a competitive swimmer (sprinter) for ~10 years.
