## A Quick Introduction!

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences (MCS) senior at Yale-NUS College. This website shall serve as a medium for me to consolidate my learning. 

## Some fun facts 

 - In 2018, I spent 6 great weeks learning Espa√±ol in Sevilla. Besides returning with a better grasp of the language, I came back as a budding Siesta practitioner.
 - I was a competitive swimmer (sprinter) for ~10 years, where I initially specialised in Breaststroke and then Butterfly in my later years. A video of me and my teammates back in 2012, doing the [Medley Relay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBbgvWIjAjQ) (Stacy-Amanda-Me-Mag)! (Here's another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swXCs3du4CA) of me when I was 13. Good memories indeed!)  
 - In Junior College, I made the transition to WaterPolo. Being left-handed, I usually played Right-wing/driver.
 - I love coffee! I briefly served as a barista post-A-levels and also became certified during my semester abroad in Australia. 
 

## Through my lens
 
 - Sometimes, I shoot :)
