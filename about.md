## A Quick Introduction!

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a ~~Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences (MCS) senior at~~ graduate of Yale-NUS College. This website shall serve as a medium for me to consolidate my learning. 

## Some fun facts 

Nothing too important here; just me reminscing the past!

 - I love coffee! I briefly served as a barista post-A-levels and also became certified during my semester abroad in Australia. 
 - In 2018, I spent 6 great weeks learning Espa√±ol in Sevilla. Besides returning with a better grasp of the language, I came back as a budding Siesta practitioner.
 - I was a competitive swimmer (sprinter) for ~10 years, where I initially specialised in Breaststroke and then Butterfly in my later years. A video of me and my teammates back in 2012, doing the [Medley Relay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBbgvWIjAjQ) (Stacy-Amanda-Me-Mag, in lane 4)! (Here's another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swXCs3du4CA) of me when I was 13. Good memories indeed!)  
 - In Junior College, I made the transition to WaterPolo. Being left-handed, I usually played Right-wing/driver. Here's a [picture](https://www.redsports.sg/2015/04/09/national-adiv-waterpolo-girls-sajc-hci/) of me and YuHan marking each other, as opponents! I did play a little at NUS, as well as in Australia, during my semester abroad.
 - I am now into a different kind of sport (think mental sport), where I excel at getting stuck on problems. 
 

## Through my lens
 
 - Sometimes, I shoot :)
