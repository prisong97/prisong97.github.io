## A Quick Introduction!

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences (MCS) senior at Yale-NUS College. This website shall serve as a centralised medium for me to consolidate my learning. 

## Some fun facts

 - In 2018, I spent 6 great weeks learning Español in Sevilla. Besides returning with a better grasp of the language, I came back as a budding Siesta practitioner.
 - I was a competitive swimmer (sprinter) for ~10 years before switching to waterpolo in Junior College.
 - I love coffee!
